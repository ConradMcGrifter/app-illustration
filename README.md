## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   I learned about setTimeout javaScript method and I learned a little bit more about css animations. I normally use transition property to animate things but the control you get with keyframes was neccessary for animating the chat bubble. I also used margin: auto to position certain elements
